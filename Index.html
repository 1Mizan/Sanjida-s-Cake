        <p style="font-size: 20px;">It was before our SSC exam.We decided to go on study tour.And the place was <b>Sylhet</b>
        So,Almost 40 of us decided to be a part of this journey.It was a 2 nights and 1 day tour.On first day,We gathered on the school premise in the afternoon.We hired a bus for the journey.Almost everyone was with their parents and relatives.We then got on the bus and started for Sylhet .We travelled the whole night and reached Sylhet at dawn around 5 o'clock.We firstl arrived at <span>Sahjalal's Majar</span> Then We got freshed there.And having breakfast in a restaurant named <i><em>Safron</em></i>,we left for <em>Sada Pathor</em>.We all were astonished at the natural beauty of Sylhet.We were enjoying the green lime nature that were bestowing us while going through the roads . Then we reached <b>Sada Pathor </b>almost at noon.Then I with my friends rushed to the scenic beauty of cold water .The water was so cold that some were shivering.Then we ate some local food and ice creams there.</p><br>
